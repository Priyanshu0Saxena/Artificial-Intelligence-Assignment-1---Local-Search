# Artificial-Intelligence-Assignment-1---Local-Search
Local Search basically starts with the random solution with some relaxed constraints and with the successor function it jumps over the best neighbouring state in which we get the better solution and we keep doing this repeatedly , the process known as hill climbing, but when we are stuck in a state where there is no best neighbouring state possible (known as local optimum) then we restart randomly with another random solution and repeated the process and store the best solution state found so far, this is the typical idea of our assignment cum project in course of Artificial Intelligence at IIT Delhi. 
Now the problem statement is : there are some villages which are flooded and we need to provide help to the people stuck in those villages with the help of some helicopters which can start only from a certain city and carry 2 edible help i.e. dry food or perishible food and 1 other help resource. The coordinates of villages and cities are given in 2D coordinate format, there is a limited weight and distance capacity of each helicopter and the number of peoples in the village. All of this data is given
Our Task: Plan a trip for each helicopter using local search in AI, using stochastic variation i.e. random restart to solve the problem, here we created a state where each helicopter is assigned some villages randomly as our start state and we are changing those assignment - either swapping, shuffling or moving some villages to get our neighbouring state and using hill climbing and random restarts we are able to find a close solution.
